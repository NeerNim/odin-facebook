# Microverse project cycle split into 9 milestones
- Each milestones needs to have seperate feature branch 
- Everytime a milestone is complete create a pull request from **milestone-feature-branch**(this branch name should be descriptive) to the master branch
- Everytime the reviewer approves the milestone-branch it then should merge to the development branch
- When all the milebranch branch is complete and merged into the development branch then it will be merged to the master branch


## Between milestones
- Use feature branches for milestones, e.g. first-milestone, next-milestone.
- While one milestone is under the review, keep working on the next milestone.
- When one milestone is approved, merge that milestoneâ€™s branch to develop branch. - - Then merge changes from refreshed develop branch to next-milestone branch and resolve conflicts.
- Continue working on the next-milestone branch.
- Repeat this process for all milestones.
- Once the entire project is production-ready merge develop branch to master branch.
